    Parameters
    ----------
    Rstim : array_like, shape (TR, N)

        Test stimuli with TP time points and N features. Each feature should be Z-scored across time.
    Rresp : array_like, shape (TR, M)

        Each response should be Z-scored across time.
    Presp : array_like, shape (TP, M)
        Test responses with TP time points and M responses.
    valphas : list or array_like, shape (M,)
        Ridge parameter for each voxel.
    normalpha : boolean
        Whether ridge parameters should be normalized by the largest singular value (LSV) norm of
        Rstim. Good for comparing models with different numbers of parameters.
    corrmin : float in [0..1]
        Purely for display purposes. After each alpha is tested, the number of responses with correlation
        greater than corrmin minus the number of responses with correlation less than negative corrmin
        will be printed. For long-running regressions this vague metric of non-centered skewness can
        give you a rough sense of how well the model is working before it's done.
    singcutoff : float
        The first step in ridge regression is computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
        stimulus Rstim. If Rstim is not full rank, some singular values will be approximately equal
        to zero and the corresponding singular vectors will be noise. These singular values/vectors
        should be removed both for speed (the fewer multiplications the better!) and accuracy. Any
        singular values less than singcutoff will be removed.
    use_corr : boolean
        If True, this function will use correlation as its metric of model fit. If False, this function
        will instead use variance explained (R-squared) as its metric of model fit. For ridge regression
        this can make a big difference -- highly regularized solutions will have very small norms and
        will thus explain very little variance while still leading to high correlations, as correlation
        is scale-free while R**2 is not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Rstim : array_like, shape (TR, N)
        Training stimuli with TR time points and N features. Each feature should be Z-scored across time.
    Rresp : array_like, shape (TR, M)
        Training responses with TR time points and M different responses (voxels, neurons, what-have-you).
        Each response should be Z-scored across time.
    Pstim : array_like, shape (TP, N)
        Test stimuli with TP time points and N features. Each feature should be Z-scored across time.
    Presp : array_like, shape (TP, M)
        Test responses with TP time points and M different responses. Each response should be Z-scored across
        time.
    alphas : list or array_like, shape (A,)
        Ridge parameters that will be tested. Should probably be log-spaced. np.logspace(0, 3, 20) works well.
    nboots : int
        The number of bootstrap samples to run. 15 to 30 works well.
    chunklen : int
        On each sample, the training data is broken into chunks of this length. This should be a few times 
        longer than your delay/STRF. e.g. for a STRF with 3 delays, I use chunks of length 10.
    nchunks : int
        The number of training chunks held out to test ridge parameters for each bootstrap sample. The product
        of nchunks and chunklen is the total number of training samples held out for each sample, and this 
        product should be about 20 percent of the total length of the training data.
    corrmin : float in [0..1], default 0.2
        Purely for display purposes. After each alpha is tested for each bootstrap sample, the number of 
        responses with correlation greater than this value will be printed. For long-running regressions this
        can give a rough sense of how well the model works before it's done.
    joined : None or list of array_like indices, default None
        If you want the STRFs for two (or more) responses to be directly comparable, you need to ensure that
        the regularization parameter that they use is the same. To do that, supply a list of the response sets
        that should use the same ridge parameter here. For example, if you have four responses, joined could
        be [np.array([0,1]), np.array([2,3])], in which case responses 0 and 1 will use the same ridge parameter
        (which will be parameter that is best on average for those two), and likewise for responses 2 and 3.
    singcutoff : float, default 1e-10
        The first step in ridge regression is computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
        stimulus Rstim. If Rstim is not full rank, some singular values will be approximately equal
        to zero and the corresponding singular vectors will be noise. These singular values/vectors
        should be removed both for speed (the fewer multiplications the better!) and accuracy. Any
        singular values less than singcutoff will be removed.
    normalpha : boolean, default False
        Whether ridge parameters (alphas) should be normalized by the largest singular value (LSV)
        norm of Rstim. Good for rigorously comparing models with different numbers of parameters.
    single_alpha : boolean, default False
        Whether to use a single alpha for all responses. Good for identification/decoding.
    use_corr : boolean, default True
        If True, this function will use correlation as its metric of model fit. If False, this function
        will instead use variance explained (R-squared) as its metric of model fit. For ridge regression
        this can make a big difference -- highly regularized solutions will have very small norms and
        will thus explain very little variance while still leading to high correlations, as correlation
        is scale-free while R**2 is not.
    return_wt : boolean, default True
        If True, this function will compute and return the regression weights after finding the best
        alpha parameter for each voxel. However, for very large models this can lead to memory issues.
        If false, this function will _not_ compute weights, but will still compute prediction performance
        on the prediction dataset (Pstim, Presp).
    
    Returns
    -------
    wt : array_like, shape (N, M)
        If [return_wt] is True, regression weights for N features and M responses. If [return_wt] is False, [].
    corrs : array_like, shape (M,)
        Validation set correlations. Predicted responses for the validation set are obtained using the regression
        weights: pred = np.dot(Pstim, wt), and then the correlation between each predicted response and each 
        column in Presp is found.
    alphas : array_like, shape (M,)
        The regularization coefficient (alpha) selected for each voxel using bootstrap cross-validation.
    bootstrap_corrs : array_like, shape (A, M, B)
        Correlation between predicted and actual responses on randomly held out portions of the training set,
        for each of A alphas, M voxels, and B bootstrap samples.
